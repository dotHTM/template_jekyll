# Template for a Jekyll/Grunt/Apache based docker preview

```bash
# Mac, linux, etc
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotHTM/template_jekyll/master/get_template.sh | bash

# alpine, things that ship with wget instead of curl
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotHTM/template_jekyll/master/get_template.sh | ash
```

The script will prompt you for a project name, which it will use to create a local repo just for you.
